Landing Page with html and css.

Running into formating and alignment issues with the header section. Hopefully I will figure it out.

Kinda did a work around with the header and hero section but I'm sure I'll realize and easier way to accomplish this with more practice.

Ran into a few issues. It took me a while to realize to make chunks of content in flex containers within a main flex container. The css does not show all of my realization because I was too tired to make the changes. Overall the format and alignmnet of my project worked out.

****Final Thoughts****

I will take what i have learned and burn it into my memory. It took me until the call to action section to realize the mistakes that I made in the header section (which was the most dificult section for me becuase I made it that way). If you are reading this then please keep going. I took me a while to figure things out, but with a litte research and help from my friend google, it all worked out.
